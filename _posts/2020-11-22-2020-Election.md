Hillary Clinton's loss to Donald Trump in the 2016 election was one of the biggest political upsets in American history. Trump flipping the pro-Obama Rust Belt states of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin in his favor despite polls predicting otherwise made the difference. Likewise, Joe Biden reclaiming these states for the Democrats, save for Ohio, has led him to victory in 2020. By comparing how each county in these states, as well as the rest of the country, voted in the past two presidential elections, we can gain insights into what votes Biden was able to earn that Clinton could not. Let's look at the following map.

![us_ddiff%](/assets/election/images/us_ddiff_pct.png)   

Much of the map is blue, indicating that throughout the country, Biden performed better than Clinton. Even in the western states that safely went to Trump in 2020 such as Utah, Idaho, and Wyoming, Trump's share of the vote was smaller than in 2016. 

The most striking aspect of the map, however, are the Texas counties along Mexican border. These counties had by far the largest shift in votes to Trump anywhere in the country. Starr County, located near the southern tip of the state, saw the greatest proportion of its voters flip from blue to red. In 2016, Clinton won 79% of the county's 11,500 votes. Biden still won the county, but with only a 52% majority. He actually won about the same number of total votes as Clinton did, but Trump saw his votes quadruple from two thousand to eight thousand. In a county where Democrats have won each election since 1896, the longest such streak in the country, seeing such a drastic red shift is curious. Starr County, like most along the Mexican border, is predominantly Hispanic. While Democrats have historically had the support of Hispanics, including in other parts of the country in this election, their waning support in southern Texas may be of alarm. 

Although these counties saw large shifts to Trump proportionally, their populations were not large enough to prevent Texas a whole from shifting towards Democrats. This map in general can be misleading since it treats each county equally. Deep red Starr County's impact is more than wiped out by light blue Dallas County. Instead of looking at propotional shifts in voting by county, we can look at the difference in the absolute number of votes from 2016 to 2020.

Biden's gain in votes over Clinton in Austin, Dallas, and Houston led to Texas shifting towards Democrats. We can also see that the votes he won that caused him to flip states such as Arizona, Michigan, and Georgia. Specifically, the counties home to Phoenix, Detroit, and Atlanta are blue, illustrating that the Biden-Trump divide is in many ways an urban-rural divide. Many large cities across the country were already comfortably in Clinton's favor in 2016, but even more voters in these cities supported Biden in 2020. 

The notable exception to the city trend is Miami. Trump enjoyed a greater increase in voters from Miami-Dade county than any other county in the nation. Ultimately, this made the difference in the always competitive Florida race. Republicans labeling Biden as a radical left socialist appears to have veered Miami's Cuban American voters towards Trump. Despite no Democratic politician in America, let alone Joe Biden, actually being a socialist, Cuban Americans believed that Biden would turn the US into more like the country they fled. If Democrats are to win Florida in 2024 and beyond, much needs to be done to win Miami's Latino vote.

To get a better idea of how Biden won the election, we can take a closer look at how he was able to flip Michigan.

Not surprisingly, Biden picked up a good deal of votes from Detroit's Wayne County. However, it was in Wayne County's neighbor to the north Oakland County where Biden gained the most votes, amassing a margin of victory fifty thousand greater than that of Clinton. These two counties exemplify Biden's diverse sources of success. While Wayne County has a large Black population, Oakland County is predominantly white and includes the wealthy cities of Bloomfield Hills and Troy. 

Kent County in the western part of the state saw Biden gain the third most votes in Michigan. Like Oakland County, Kent County is mostly white. However, Kent County has just a third of the per capita income of Oakland County. Poor, white, uneducated voters were a major reason Trump won in 2016. Indeed, Trump carried Kent County in 2016 by ten thousand votes. In 2020, however, Biden won the county by over twenty thousand votes, winning a greater percentage of votes than any Democrat since Lyndon Johnson in 1964. The winner-take-all nature of the electoral college, for better or worse (usually for the worse in my opinion), allows seemingly minor shifts in voter sentiment in certain counties to decide the president for the rest of the country. Trump winning Kent and other similar counties won him Michigan, and ultimately the country, in 2016; Biden doing so in 2020 led to the same result.

One of the storylines of the 2020 election was the historic voter turnout. More votes were cast in 2020 than were cast in any other election, and about two-third of eligible voters actually submitted a ballot, the highest proportion since 1900. But this increase in turnout was not evenly distributed across the country. 

![us_todiff_pct](/assets/election/images/us_todiff_pct.png)

Most counties in the country saw an increase in votes cast from 2016 to 2020. We can observe a correlation between areas where Biden did well and an increase in overall votes. There was clearly a greater increase in turnout in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania than in Ohio. The first three all flipped to Biden while Ohio stayed with Trump. Also visible are the large increases in turnout in counties around Atlanta and Phoenix, leading Georgia and Arizona respectively to go to Biden. Even safely blue states like California and Washington saw big increases in turnout, as did safely red states like Tennessee and Utah. A takeaway from these turnout trends is that most new voters in 2020 voted for Biden. A noticeable exception is Florida, where most of the state saw more voters but still voted for Trump.

Turnout increases were not seen in counties in the deep South, especially around the Mississippi River. Let's take a closer look. 

![south_todiff_pct](/assets/election/images/south_todiff_pct.png)

Compared to most of the country, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Alabama have very few counties that saw great increases in turnout. A decent number of counties in these states actually had fewer people vote than four years ago. There is also a band of counties stretching northeast from southern Georgia to eastern North Carolina with lower turnout margins than those around them. Why did 2020's turnout wave leave these counties behind? The demographics of these counties may provide part of the answer.

![south_black](/assets/election/images/south_black.png)

A visible correlation exists between counties with lower turnouts and counties with high Black populations. The counties around the Mississppi River, among the Blackest in country, are the same counties that saw some of the largest drops in voters. The Black southern and eastern edges of Arkansas saw decreased turnout while the white remainder of the state saw modest increases. The Georgia to North Carolina strip of counties mentioned earlier is also predominantly Black. 

Voter engagement having such a variance on the basis of race is a cause for concern. There's no one explanation for this trend; the Black vote is not a singular entity. Perhaps Black voters in the South were less compelled by either candidate than their white counterparts and therefore decided not to vote. Southern states are also harder to vote in than most in the country. For example, Mississippi has strict voter ID requirements, permanently disenfranchises certain felons, and does not allow early voting, even during a pandemic. Obviously, if it is harder to vote, turnout will be lower. In any case, it is important for the country to make an effort to understand the reasons why certain populations vote less than others and try to close any such gaps. 

A deviation from this racial trend is found in the counties near Atlanta in northern Georgia. These counties saw some of the greatest turnout increases in the country despite having large Black populations. This fact reiterates that all Black voters (and Black non-voters) cannot be viewed together. Perhaps Black voters in urban areas were more likely to vote than those in rural areas. 

![black_to_plot](/assets/election/images/black_to_plot.png)

The above plot shows the relationship between how Black a county is and the change in turnout over the past two elections, where each dot is sized according to each county's population density. We can generally consider counties represented by larger dots to contain cities and be urban, while rural counties show up as small dots. The first fact to note is that the vast majority of counties had postive changes in turnout. Our dicussion is not necessarily about why counties saw drops in turnouts, but rather why some counties saw smaller gains in turnout than others. With that said, almost all counties that actually did have fewer voters than in 2016 were rural.

The plot shows a general trend which agrees with the maps we looked at earlier: the more Black a county is, the less the turnout margin is. However, if we isolate densely and sparsely populated counties, we discover that this trend only holds true in certain cases. 

![black_tosmall_plot](/assets/election/images/black_tosmall_plot.png)

![black_tobig_plot](/assets/election/images/black_tobig_plot.png)

In the top plot, we only keep counties with population densities lower than forty people per square mile, while the bottom plot has only those with densities above eight hundred people per square mile. In rural counties, the negative correlation is still visible. Almost all rural majority Black counties saw less than a ten percent increase in votes, and none saw an increase close to twenty percent. On the other hand voter turnout in dense, urban counties was more or less unaffected by how Black the counties are. Three of the four majority Black dense counties had a greater than ten percent increase in votes. In fact, the Blackest of these counties, Clayton County, part of the Atlanta metropolitan area, saw an increase greater than twenty percent. 

We can go one step further and look at not only how many people in these counties voted, but who they voted for. 

![black_ddiff_plot](/assets/election/images/black_ddiff_plot.png)

No clear relationship appears to exist between Biden's margin over Clinton and a county's Black population. However, like for voter turnout, there is a division between urban an rural counties. Almost every urban county gave Biden a greater share of the vote than Clinton, while the opposite is true for rural counties. Most counties that strongly shifted towards Biden are predominantly white. This makes sense, since Biden benefitted from increased turnout, and we saw that turnout was increased more in whiter counties. Meanwhile, almost every county where Trump did better in 2020 than 2016 is rural. Losing out of the black rural counties in North Carolina, for instance, may have been a factor in why Biden was unable to flip the state as Democrats hoped. 

By looking at these maps and plots, we've been able to gain some insight into how Joe Biden was able to beat Donald Trump and why Hillary Clinton could not. Biden won voters throughout the country in areas where Trump won in 2016. Democrats should still be concerned, however, about the populations they did not win over. Biden will take office during a trying time for the nation (although it feels like we say that about every new president) and have the tremendous responsiblity of being the leader of all Americans, not just the ones who voted for him.
